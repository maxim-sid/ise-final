            One of the best experiences that I had during my high school was working on a project to redesign athletic
            apparel for my school. As a member of the design team, my responsibility was to creating modern looks for
            the T-shirts worn during our annual Sports Day. It was both exciting and intimidating at the same time.
            Knowing that designs, created by me would represent the entire student spirit and would need to be aligned
            with the school's guidelines. At the start, the journey wasn't so easy as we faced challenges with
            materials, quality, pricing and delays from the apparel company itself. However, despite all of these obstacles,
            our team worked hard to deliver the samples in time for the event. Although we had to drop some items like
            caps, we successfully introduced samples of T-shirts in time for the event. What made this experience
            special, was collaboration with my group. Working together on the solution, helped us build stronger bonds and sharpened
            skills like communication, critical-thinking, and project management. This experience was a great
            practice of teamwork and perseverance, which reminded me how much I enjoy bringing creative ideas to life.
